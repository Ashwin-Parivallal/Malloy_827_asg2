Translation of programming languages assignments
This assignment needed me to take text input from the user and turn the text to upside down and reverse format. So the output should be reverse and upside down. The input method can be either stdin or from a file. I am using flex to create a scanner which reads in the text as tokens and sends it to the main method that performs the required transformation.
